# Playbooks for interacting with the phpipam api
With a working phpipam install you can enable the api and use these interactions inside of playbooks.

### Setting up the API for usage in Ansible

### Getting the API token
Making the call to the API will pull down the token
which is then stored in a variable and used throughout the playbook
